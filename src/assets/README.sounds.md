Place optional sound files here:

- correct.mp3 — played when the user selects a correct answer
- fail.mp3 — played when the user selects a wrong answer (or timeout)
- success.mp3 — played on results if pct >= 80
- wrong.mp3 — played on results if pct <= 79

If these files are not present, the app will fall back to a short WebAudio beep so there is still audible feedback.
